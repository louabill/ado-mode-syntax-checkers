## Ado-mode syntax testers

Here live the syntax-testers for `ado-mode`, which can be found at
https://github.com/louabill/ado-mode .
`ado-mode` is an Emacs major mode for editing Stata-related files.

The files fulfill a couple of purposes:

* If you are wanting to mess with `ado-mode` because there is a highlighting problem, these will help you see if your changes help or hurt.

* If you feel like checking the history of official Stata commands, you can see when various commands were added or removed. Of course, using `M-x dired <path-to-Stata>/ado/base/w/what*.sthlp`, followed by `% g <command-name>`, will allow you to search all the `whatsnew` files, too.

The git history for the files before 2021 is in the history for `ado-mode`.
